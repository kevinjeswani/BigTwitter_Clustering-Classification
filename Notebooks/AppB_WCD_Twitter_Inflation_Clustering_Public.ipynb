    "By: Kevin Jeswani & Junaid Zafar <br>\n",
    "The set of notebooks are segmented for the purpose of clarity & convenience <br>\n",
    "The following is the suggested order for running the scripts:\n",
    "- '1_WCD_Twitter_Inflation_Classification' - Mounted S3 bucket for inflation tweets, copied over twitter data, tweet cleaning. VADER & Spark-NLP pre-trained model is used to apply labels to the inflation tweets. The data is then transformed with spark-ml. Logistic regression & random forest are built and trained with gridsearchCV on the label and transformed token features.\n",
    "- '2_WCD_Twitter_AllTopics_Clustering'  - All topics in the WCD twitter bucket are filtered, custom transformers are built and inserted into an extensive pipeline to load raw data from Kinesis firehose. Clustering uses Latent Dirichlet Allocation is conducted using a custom gridsearch to perform topic modelling.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Appendices** - Please note these notebooks are included simply as supporting information and to show that other experiments and exercises were conduct. Less time and effort was spent formatting on these notebooks, whereas Notebook 1) and 2) are the main submission documents.\n",
    "- 'AppA_WCD_Twitter_Inflation_Classification_MLPOnly' - Experimentation for classification with multi-layer perceptron models - originally at the end of Notebook 1)\n",
    "- 'AppB_WCD_Twitter_Inflation_Clustering' **This Notebook**  -Inflation tweet data with Spark-NLP labels imported, custom transformer for data cleaning built and combined with standard nlp transformers in a pipeline. LDA clustering implemented to model topics in the inflation dataset. An attempt was made with a GMM clustering model.\n",
    "- 'AppC_WCD_Twitter_AllTopics_52mil_Clustering' - ALL streamed tweets (55mil+) are loaded from the WCD bucket, a transformation pipeline is built and all the data is transformed. A LDM clustering is built to cluster all the topics. \n",
    "- 'AppD_WCD_Twitter_AllTopics_Clustering_Evaluation' - An attempt was made to visualize the clustering using principal component analysis and t-SNE, but the data transformation required was too heavy to process and other issues occured."

    "NLP text clustering using LDA = topic modelling. <br>\n",
    "Terms:\n",
    "- Word = basic unit of text data index from a vocabulary set with V elements: {1,...,V}\n",
    "- Document = sequence of N words, w = (w_1,w_2,…w_N) ,w_n is the nth word in document\n",
    "- Corpus = sequence of M documents, D = (w_1, w_2,…w_M)\n",
    "- Topic = distribution of words, with LDA treating each document in the corpus as mixture of topics\n",
    "How LDA works: 3-level heirarchical bayesian model\n",
    "- Estimates two distribution sets in the corpus: \n",
    "    - word distribution of each topic(θ); which follows Dirichlet distribution\n",
    "    - topic distribution over corpus (Z)\n",
    "- Latent variables (θ & Z) are defined in the text generation process\n",
    "- Probability distribution of P(θ_d), P(Z_dn|θ_d), and P(w_dn|z_dn) are defined and the joint distribution, P(w,z,θ), is calculated <br>\n",
    "Advantages:\n",
    "- Can find latent topics in the document; which can be interpretable\n",
    "- Unsupervised = no label required\n",
    "- Easy to train, can retain word representation <br>\n",
    "Disadvantages:\n",
    "- Document considered as bag of words; word order and semantic information (multiple meanings) ignored\n",
    "- Topic # = fixed; can be uncorrelated and the topic distribution cannot capture correlations\n",
    "- Static (no topic evolution over time)\n",
